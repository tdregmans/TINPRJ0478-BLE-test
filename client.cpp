 * 
 * This is a piece of code for an ESP32. This works in together with BLEserver.ino
 * Together, they measure the speed of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This helps answer
 * research question as formulated in "Research Report 4 (Experimental Research for Bluetooth range) (Thijs Dregmans).pdf"
 * 
 * The code is copied from https://www.electronicshub.org/esp32-ble-tutorial/ and modified to fit the purpose.
