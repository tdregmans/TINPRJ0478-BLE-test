Code for Experimental Research: Research Report 4 (Experimental Research for Bluetooth range) (Thijs Dregmans) in Project 7/8

## Introduction to the research
Pick-to-Light means that through some means – in our case a app on your mobile device – it is possible to turn on a LED that is connected to the item that you need. You simply follow the instructions in the app and find the LED that turned on. To build this system, we want to use Bluetooth for the connection between the P2L (Pick-to-Light) clients and the Station that controls the P2L clients. We need to be sure that the Bluetooth connection is available in the whole warehouse. Through this Experimental research, we check this.
The central research question is:
“What is the effect of distance and obstacles on the speed and availability of Bluetooth between two ESP32?”
In the warehouse, there will be a distance between the Station and the P2L client. We need to know what impact this distance has on the speed and availability of the Bluetooth connection. Another factor that could play a significant role, are potential obstacles between the Station and the P2L client. We’d also like to know the impact this has on the speed and availability.
There are 2 major characteristics of Bluetooth that are important to the P2L system, that can be endangered by distance and/or obstacles: speed and availability. It may be the case that, due to distance and/or obstacles, the Bluetooth connections fail altogether. With ‘availability’ we mean that the Bluetooth connection can exist. Besides that, it is also possible that, due to distance and/or obstacles, the Bluetooth connections become slow. Slowness is less of a problem than unavailability, but can become important when the number of P2L clients increase.
